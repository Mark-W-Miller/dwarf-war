# Dwarf War — Excerpt Digest

Source: docs/Dwarf_War_Full.pdf (extracted to docs/Dwarf_War_Full.txt)

## Summary

King Hogan’s barrow is under a grinding siege by Glonards (degenerate dwarves) pouring from wild caves. Hogan commands from a War Room using a living granite model of the barrow, focusing on holding Dento, the earthmost carddon near rich veins. Xeras (Sweeny, Hawist) perform precise, tunnel‑safe fire magic at high personal and gem cost. Strategy is defensive in the cramped tunnels, with a drastic option to collapse Greco to deny access. Stakes are existential: if Glonards reach the main veins heartward of Dento, the barrow may fall despite favorable kill ratios.

## Key Terms (from excerpt)

- Glonards: Degenerate dwarves; numerous, fearless of collateral; avoid daylight.
- Carddon: Civilized cavern; named hubs (Honwee, Dento, Greco); tracks integrity/beauty.
- War Room Stone Model: 30‑ft granite miniature (ruby‑powered) reflecting tunnels, caverns, and unit positions.
- Xera: Dwarven mage using precision, tunnel‑safe casting; gem‑powered; fatigue matters.
- Kartha’s Signal Stones: Communications between observers and the War Room.
- Mantle: Ten‑foot perimeter walkway in a carddon (notably Dento).
- Entrance Hall/Daylight: Surface‑connected hall; daylight repels Glonards.

## Locations

- Honwee: Central hub carddon (hub‑and‑spoke layout).
- Dento: Earthmost carddon by the richest veins; lattice of 5×5 mining tunnels; current focal point.
- Greco: Carddon considered for tactical collapse to block enemy advance.

## Mechanics Hooks

- War Room UI: Player issues orders via the manipulable “stone model.”
- Threat/Spawn: Wild caves act as spawners with uncertain counts (fog of war).
- Structural Integrity: Bridges/tunnels/carddons can collapse; repairs and bracing restore integrity.
- Magic Economy: Xera actions consume gems and cause fatigue; precision vs. collateral trade‑offs.
- Daylight Aversion: Environmental repellent near surface entrances.
- Logistics: Brigades (~500 dwarves) suffer attrition and rotate by order.

## Design Mappings

- Objectives: “Hold Dento”; optional “Collapse Greco” with moral/beauty/pain cost.
- Systems: IntegritySystem (tunnels/carddons), ThreatClock (cave spawns), PainSystem (structural/ornament loss), CommandSystem (orders via model).
- Units/Tags: Dwarves, Glonards, Xera; brigades as groups; Orders via AI paths.
