- **Barrow:** Cultural heart; source of identity; damage → pain.
- **Tunnel (Class):** Engineering crawl, passage, or grand hall.
- **Heartward:** Direction deeper into the mountain.
- **Wild Cavern:** Natural void; denizen spawner; partial workings possible.
- **Ornamentation:** Carvings, inlays, iconography; buffers pain.
- **Dwarven Pain:** Morale/stress meter triggered by structural or beauty harm.

- **Carddon:** Civilized cavern (living/working); named hubs (e.g., Honwee, Dento, Greco); tracks integrity and beauty.

- **Glonards:** Degenerate dwarves; primary foes; swarm from wild caves; avoid daylight.
- **Xera:** Dwarven mage; tunnel‑safe precision casting; actions consume gems and stamina.
